I did my masters (M.Tech) from IIT Madras. Since then I have worked in diverse roles from applying Deep learning solutions for Source code mining to developing Responsive front-end single page applications to developing Micro-Services and scalable backend worker jobs.
 
As part of Masters degree worked on developing a Transductive Inference (semi-supervised approach) to classify data from multiple source and having relations among them. The work got published in IJCAI 
http://ijcai.org/Abstract/15/533 
 
In Amazon, currently working on Customer Behavior Analytics where I'm involved with handling terabytes of data using Spark EMR clusters, SWF pipelines, model building and model training as well.

In Machine Learning/ Deep Learning further worked on git repo mining. Worked on embedding source code symbols to real vector space using word2vec on context of symbols in AST. Further applying RNNs on source code to find similar commits.
Also, worked on Transfer learning in context of image classification applying pre-trained Neural Networks.

In front end built rich Single Page Applications using Angular and Material Design. In backend developed REST APIs, RPC with focus on operational excellence.
 
Also, love to learn different paradigms of programming languages and technologies like Golang (simplicity and concurrency), Python (higher order functions, decorators etc.), Java etc.
 
In short, I am an opinionated programmer advocating typesafe code who enjoy every paradigm of application development.
